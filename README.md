Let's practice our SQL skills using the famous [SQL ZOO](https://sqlzoo.net/) (it's been around for **20** years!!)

Open up the `practice.sql` file and do all of your work in there. You will be testing each answer on the site and the copying it into the correct place in our file. Let's do this!!

## INSTRUCTIONS

- Complete sections 0-3 on SQL Zoo and paste a copy of each query in the `practice.sql` file

- Try section 6 - JOINS (if you don't get them all, that's ok) and paste the answers in `practice.sql`
